Welcome to Mountain Mayhem!!

This is a simple 2D explorer game I made in my Software Engineering class during my Sophmore year at App State. 
To play the game, download the ZIP file and extract it into a folder and open it using an IDE. navigate to the bin folder and type 'java main.Main' into the terminal
or navigate to src/main and press the play button(in the upper right corner in VSCode)

When originally submitted, the game had a handful of features and gameplay that boiled down to:
- a moveable character that could travel around the map
- collectable resources that either gave you a boost(energy drink) or gave currency(bit-coins)
- doors that could only be opened if you had the required cost
- a chest that, once reached, wins you the game

Since then, I adjusted the scope of the project and made a lot of changes. I'm sure you can see the inspiration...
Current features include:
